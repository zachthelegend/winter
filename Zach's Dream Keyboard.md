# Project Name "Zach's Digital Keyboard"

## Summary

What are you going to build? What does it do? Why are you excited to build it?

I am going to build a glass display keyboard that looks like a normal piece of glass until you open it. When it is open it will light up illuminating the outline of a keyboard.
There is no clicks or buttons so it will all be touch based. I am excited because this is a novel idea which incorporates the old keyboard and a new minimalistic type of keyboard.



## Plan

What steps are you going to take to build it? What tools are you going to use? What will you do first, second, third, etc.?

This will be a prototype project just to prove concept. I will use touch screen to be the dreaming keyboard. It is controlled by microcontroller. The microcontroller will receive key down information and generate flashing light and through wi-fi to send the key down information to PC.

I need to Raspberry Pi Kit and a touch screen. 

1. use Raspberry Pi Kit control touch screen to display a virtual keyboard on it.
2. When touching the virtual key on the touch screen, Raspberry Pi receive it.
3. Raspberry Pi generates flashing light depend on the key.
